What Is Alpha and Beta Testing?
Once the initial development and software testing are complete, it is important to have the application tested by testers and real users. This is where alpha and beta testing come in.

Alpha testing is done by a select group of testers who go through the application to ensure there are no bugs before it is released into the marketplace. This is part of acceptance testing, which ensures that the software application meets the needs of users before its release.

Alpha testing also utilizes both white and black box testing techniques. Black box testing only focuses on the expected behavior of the application, whereas white box testing involves the tester knowing the internal components and performing tests on that.

After the alpha testing phase, there is the beta testing phase. This is where the application is made available to real users. Actual users can interact with the application and provide feedback. This is a form of user acceptance testing which ensures that the application meets the business requirements as well as user needs.

While both stages of testing can be time-consuming, it is important to perform alpha and beta tests on your applications. This will help ensure that the application is truly ready for the marketplace and meets the needs of its users.
